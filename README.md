# Smart Lights Integrator
Extensible integrator for existing Smart Lights systems.

Nowadays, we are facing a significant problem with light pollution in cities. City street lights emit light with the highest intensity regarding the used light source and are usually relatively inefficient.

Intelligent street lights improve the situation by decreasing the intensity of the emitted light, temperature of the light and reducing total power consumption by various aspects. The biggest problem with the existing intelligent street lights is the initial investment as there's a necessity to change the electric infrastructure, relatively high development and maintenance costs. Another problem for consideration is the interoperability between various solutions, as they can't communicate with each other, so the system cannot be scalable.

This approach should focus more on the integration of various existing intelligent street lights, assess the interoperability between them, aggregate data, and simplify their manageability in open-source fashion development. The system should be highly-available, extendible, and scalable.
